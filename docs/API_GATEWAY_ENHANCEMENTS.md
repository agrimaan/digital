# API Gateway Enhancements

## Overview

This document describes the enhancements made to the API Gateway for the Agrimaan microservices platform. These enhancements improve the security, reliability, and maintainability of the API Gateway.

## Enhancements

### 1. Request Validation

We've implemented comprehensive request validation using Joi and JSON Schema. All incoming requests are validated against predefined schemas to ensure they meet the required format and contain all necessary data.

**Key Features:**
- Schema-based validation for all API endpoints
- Custom validation functions for complex validation logic
- Clear error messages for validation failures
- Support for different validation libraries (Joi, Ajv)

**Implementation:**
- Created validation middleware in `src/middleware/validation.js`
- Defined validation schemas in `src/validation/schemas.js`
- Integrated validation into the request processing pipeline

### 2. API Versioning

We've added support for API versioning to ensure backward compatibility when APIs change. Clients can specify the desired API version using the `x-api-version` header.

**Key Features:**
- Header-based versioning using `x-api-version` header
- Default version (v1) if no version is specified
- Fallback to latest version if requested version is not available
- Support for multiple versions of the same endpoint

**Implementation:**
- Created version router in `src/versioning/version-router.js`
- Integrated versioning into the route definitions
- Added version middleware to extract version from request headers

### 3. Caching

We've implemented response caching using Redis to improve performance and reduce load on backend services. Responses are cached for a configurable duration and served from cache when possible.

**Key Features:**
- Redis-based caching for improved performance
- Configurable cache duration per endpoint
- Cache headers to indicate cache status
- Cache invalidation for specific endpoints
- Skip caching for authenticated user-specific requests

**Implementation:**
- Created caching middleware in `src/middleware/cache.js`
- Integrated Redis client for cache storage
- Added cache headers to responses
- Implemented cache invalidation functionality

### 4. API Documentation

We've added comprehensive API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI. The documentation provides interactive documentation for all endpoints, including request/response examples and authentication requirements.

**Key Features:**
- Interactive Swagger UI at `/api-docs`
- Complete documentation for all endpoints
- Request and response examples
- Authentication requirements
- Schema definitions for all data models

**Implementation:**
- Created Swagger configuration in `src/docs/swagger.js`
- Defined OpenAPI specification for all endpoints
- Added schema definitions for all data models
- Integrated Swagger UI for interactive documentation

## Additional Improvements

### 1. Error Handling

We've improved error handling to provide consistent error responses and better error logging.

**Key Features:**
- Consistent error response format
- Detailed error messages in development mode
- Error logging with context and stack traces
- Correlation IDs for request tracing

**Implementation:**
- Created error handling middleware in `src/middleware/error-handler.js`
- Added utility functions for creating errors with status codes
- Integrated error handling into the request processing pipeline

### 2. Logging

We've enhanced logging to provide better visibility into API Gateway operations.

**Key Features:**
- Request and response logging
- Correlation IDs for request tracing
- Performance metrics (request duration)
- Configurable log levels

**Implementation:**
- Created logging middleware in `src/middleware/logging.js`
- Integrated Winston for structured logging
- Added correlation IDs to all logs
- Configured log levels based on environment

### 3. Correlation IDs

We've added correlation IDs to track requests across services and improve observability.

**Key Features:**
- Unique ID for each request
- Propagation of IDs between services
- Inclusion in logs and error responses
- Support for client-provided IDs

**Implementation:**
- Created correlation ID middleware in `src/middleware/correlation-id.js`
- Added correlation ID to request context
- Propagated correlation ID to downstream services
- Included correlation ID in response headers

## Architecture

The enhanced API Gateway follows a middleware-based architecture:

1. **Request Handling**:
   - Parsing request body
   - Adding correlation ID
   - Logging request
   - Authenticating user

2. **Request Processing**:
   - Validating request
   - Checking cache
   - Determining API version

3. **Request Routing**:
   - Discovering service
   - Creating dynamic proxy
   - Routing request to service

4. **Response Processing**:
   - Caching response
   - Logging response
   - Error handling

## Conclusion

These enhancements significantly improve the API Gateway's functionality, security, and maintainability. The API Gateway now provides a robust entry point for all client requests, with comprehensive validation, versioning, caching, and documentation.
