# Agrimaan Platform Integration

## Overview

This repository contains the integration components, scripts, and documentation for the Agrimaan microservices platform. The platform consists of 11 backend microservices and 6 frontend microservices, all of which have been implemented with their core functionalities. The integration components enable these services to work together seamlessly as a cohesive system.

## Integration Components

### 1. Service Discovery (Consul)

Enables dynamic service registration and discovery, eliminating the need for hardcoded service endpoints.

**Key Components:**
- Consul server for service registration and discovery
- Service registry module for registering services
- Service discovery client for discovering services
- Health check middleware for monitoring service health

### 2. Circuit Breaker Pattern (Resilience4j)

Prevents cascading failures in the system by implementing circuit breaker, retry, and fallback mechanisms.

**Key Components:**
- Resilient HTTP client with circuit breaker integration
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Fallback strategies for service failures
- Service clients for common services

### 3. Message Queue (RabbitMQ)

Enables asynchronous communication between services, improving system scalability and resilience.

**Key Components:**
- Message broker client with connection management
- Event publisher for sending events
- Event subscriber for receiving events
- Task queue for background processing

### 4. Observability Stack

#### 4.1 Centralized Logging (ELK Stack)

Collects, processes, and visualizes logs from all services for improved troubleshooting and observability.

**Key Components:**
- Elasticsearch for log storage and indexing
- Logstash for log processing and transformation
- Kibana for log visualization and analysis
- Filebeat for log collection

#### 4.2 Monitoring (Prometheus & Grafana)

Collects, stores, and visualizes metrics from all services for real-time monitoring and alerting.

**Key Components:**
- Prometheus for metrics collection and storage
- Grafana for metrics visualization and dashboards
- Node Exporter for host metrics
- cAdvisor for container metrics

#### 4.3 Distributed Tracing (Jaeger)

Traces requests across multiple services for end-to-end visibility and performance analysis.

**Key Components:**
- Jaeger for trace collection, storage, and visualization
- OpenTelemetry for instrumentation
- Correlation IDs for request tracking
- Sampling and retention policies

## Integration Scripts

The repository includes several scripts to automate the integration process:

1. **integrate-service-discovery.sh**: Integrates service discovery with all backend microservices
2. **integrate-circuit-breaker.sh**: Integrates circuit breaker pattern with all backend microservices
3. **integrate-message-queue.sh**: Integrates message queue with all backend microservices
4. **integrate-all-components.sh**: Runs all three integration scripts in sequence
5. **setup-elk-stack.sh**: Sets up the ELK Stack for centralized logging
6. **setup-prometheus-grafana.sh**: Sets up Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring
7. **setup-distributed-tracing.sh**: Sets up Jaeger for distributed tracing
8. **setup-monitoring-logging.sh**: Sets up both ELK Stack and Prometheus/Grafana
9. **execute-all-integrations.sh**: Executes all integration steps in sequence

## Documentation

The repository includes comprehensive documentation for the integration process:

1. **integration-execution-guide.md**: Step-by-step guide for executing the integration scripts
2. **integration-testing-plan.md**: Comprehensive testing plan for the integrated components
3. **deployment-plan.md**: Detailed deployment plan for the Agrimaan platform
4. **agrimaan-integration-summary.md**: Summary of the integration work and next steps

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js and npm
- Git
- Access to the Agrimaan microservices repository

### Integration Process

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/agrimaan/agrimaan-microservices.git
   cd agrimaan-microservices-complete
   ```

2. **Make all scripts executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/*.sh
   ```

3. **Run the master integration script**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/execute-all-integrations.sh
   ```

   This script will:
   - Integrate Service Discovery, Circuit Breaker, and Message Queue with all microservices
   - Set up centralized logging with ELK Stack
   - Set up monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
   - Set up distributed tracing with Jaeger
   - Start all services with Docker Compose

4. **Alternatively, run individual integration scripts**:

   a. **Integrate core components**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/integrate-all-components.sh
   ```

   b. **Set up logging and monitoring**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-monitoring-logging.sh
   ```

   c. **Set up distributed tracing**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-distributed-tracing.sh
   ```

### Verification

1. **Service Discovery**:
   - Access Consul UI: http://localhost:8500
   - Verify that all services are registered and healthy

2. **Circuit Breaker**:
   - Test service-to-service communication
   - Example: `curl http://localhost:3002/api/users/1`
   - Verify fallback behavior by stopping a service

3. **Message Queue**:
   - Access RabbitMQ Management UI: http://localhost:15672 (guest/guest)
   - Verify exchanges and queues are created
   - Test event publishing and subscribing

4. **Centralized Logging**:
   - Access Kibana: http://localhost:5601
   - Create index pattern: agrimaan-logs-*
   - View logs in Discover tab
   - Create visualizations and dashboards

5. **Monitoring**:
   - Access Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
   - Access Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)
   - View microservices dashboard
   - Test alerting rules

6. **Distributed Tracing**:
   - Access Jaeger UI: http://localhost:16686
   - Generate some traffic to the services
   - View traces and spans
   - Create custom views for key transactions

## Next Steps

After completing the integration process, consider the following next steps:

1. **Testing**:
   - Implement unit tests for individual services
   - Create integration tests for service interactions
   - Set up end-to-end testing
   - Perform load testing and stress testing

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Set up build automation
   - Configure test automation
   - Implement deployment automation
   - Set up environment promotion

3. **Kubernetes Deployment**:
   - Create Kubernetes manifests
   - Set up Helm charts
   - Configure auto-scaling
   - Implement blue-green deployment

4. **Additional Documentation**:
   - Update API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
   - Create architecture diagrams
   - Document deployment procedures
   - Write developer onboarding guide
