  - .env file for environment variables
  - nginx.conf for serving the application
  - Basic React application setup with TypeScript

- **State Management**
  - Redux store setup with Redux Toolkit
  - Auth slice for authentication state
  - Users slice for user management
  - Settings slice for system settings
  - Reports slice for report management
  - Monitoring slice for system health data
  - Notifications slice for system notifications

- **API Services**
  - Authentication service for admin login
  - User service for managing users and roles
  - Settings service for system configuration
  - Reports service for generating and retrieving reports
  - Monitoring service for system health data
  - Notification service for system notifications

- **Core Components**
  - Layout component with admin dashboard layout
  - PrivateRoute component for authentication
  - DataTable component for displaying and managing data
  - Form components (Input, Select, Checkbox, DatePicker, etc.)
  - Dashboard widgets (Stats, Activity, Alerts, System Health)
  - Charts and graphs (Line, Bar, Pie, Area)
  - Modal dialogs (Confirmation, Form, Alert)

  - System Settings pages (general, security, integration, notification)
  - Reports pages (listing, generation, viewing)
  - Audit Logs pages (activity, security, system)
  - Service Monitoring pages (overview, services, alerts, performance)
  - Content Management pages (content, FAQs, announcements)
  - NotFound page for 404 errors

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- React 18
- TypeScript
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- Material UI for UI components
- Axios for API requests
- React Router for routing
- Recharts for data visualization

### API Integration
The service integrates with several backend microservices:
- User Service (authentication and user management)
- Admin Service (system settings and configuration)
- Analytics Service (data analysis and reporting)
- Notification Service (system notifications)
- Monitoring Service (system health and performance)

### Routing Structure
- `/` - Redirects to dashboard
- `/login` - Login page
- `/dashboard` - Main dashboard
- `/users/*` - User management pages
- `/settings/*` - System settings pages
- `/reports/*` - Reports pages
- `/audit-logs` - Audit logs page
- `/service-monitoring` - Service monitoring page
- `/content-management/*` - Content management pages

## Deployment
The service is configured to run on port 5006 and is containerized using Docker. It can be deployed as part of the overall Agrimaan microservices architecture.

## Next Steps
1. Test routing and API integration
2. Update Docker configuration
3. Document the service
4. Deploy to production

## Future Enhancements
1. Implement real-time monitoring with WebSockets
2. Add advanced analytics and reporting features
3. Implement role-based access control for admin users
4. Add multi-language support
5. Implement dark mode theme
