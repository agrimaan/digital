# Agrimaan Platform Integration Tasks

## 1. Service Discovery Implementation
- [x] Research service discovery options (Consul, Eureka, etcd)
- [x] Select appropriate service discovery solution for the Agrimaan platform
- [x] Create service discovery configuration
- [x] Implement service registration for each microservice
- [x] Implement service discovery client in each microservice
- [x] Update API gateway to use service discovery
- [x] Test service discovery with multiple service instances

## 2. Inter-Service Communication Enhancement
- [x] Implement circuit breaker pattern (using libraries like Hystrix or Resilience4j)
- [x] Add retry mechanisms for service communication
- [x] Implement timeout handling for service requests
- [x] Create fallback mechanisms for service failures
- [x] Add correlation IDs for request tracing across services
- [x] Implement message queue for asynchronous communication (RabbitMQ or Kafka)
- [x] Configure event-driven communication between services

## 3. API Gateway Enhancement
- [x] Implement request logging and monitoring
- [ ] Add request validation middleware
