# Interactive Field Mapping Interface Enhancement Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to enhance the field mapping capabilities of the AgriTech application, providing farmers with advanced GIS tools for field management, visualization, and analysis.

## Current Status
- Basic field map component exists (`FieldMap.tsx`)
- Need to enhance with more interactive features and data visualization

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Enhance GIS Integration
- Upgrade Leaflet.js implementation with additional plugins
- Integrate with GeoServer for advanced GIS capabilities
- Add support for various map layers:
  - Topographic maps
  - Soil type maps
  - Vegetation index maps
  - Yield maps
  - Historical imagery
- Implement map caching for offline use
- Add support for custom map layers

### 2. Add Satellite Imagery Overlay
- Integrate with satellite imagery providers (Sentinel, Landsat)
- Implement time series satellite imagery
- Create NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) visualization
- Add false color composites for crop health analysis
- Implement cloud masking for clear imagery
- Create comparison slider for temporal analysis
- Add automatic field boundary detection from imagery

### 3. Create Field Boundary Drawing Tools
- Implement polygon drawing tools for field boundaries
- Add point, line, and area measurement tools
- Create field splitting and merging functionality
- Implement snapping to existing boundaries
- Add GPS integration for field walking
- Create boundary import/export functionality (GeoJSON, Shapefile)
- Implement undo/redo functionality for edits

### 4. Develop Crop Rotation Visualization
- Create temporal visualization of crop rotations
- Implement crop rotation planning tool
- Add historical crop data visualization
- Create crop rotation recommendation engine
- Implement season-by-season planning view
- Add crop compatibility matrix
- Create yield prediction based on rotation history

### 5. Add Soil Zone Mapping
- Implement soil sampling point management
- Create interpolated soil property maps:
  - pH levels
  - Nutrient levels (N, P, K)
  - Organic matter content
  - Soil texture
- Add variable rate application zone creation
- Implement prescription map generation
- Create soil amendment recommendation tool
- Add soil health trend analysis

## Technical Approach
- Use Leaflet.js as the base mapping library
- Implement React hooks for map state management
- Use Web Workers for intensive GIS calculations
- Implement WebGL for high-performance rendering
- Use IndexedDB for offline map data storage
- Implement canvas-based drawing tools for boundaries
- Use turf.js for geospatial analysis
